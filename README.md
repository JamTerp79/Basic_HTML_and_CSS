# Basic_HTML_and_CSS
HTML and Css Assignments for Tech Academy
Over this course, I have created and worked within various html and css files to create websites.  
From referencing, styling, classes, id's, to publishing an actual site has been an exciting adventure!
We created a website for a space station, a basic recipe website, and a portfolio website.
All of these are saved in seperate repositories, but are all public if you want to check them out.
